# 3D LiDAR Activity Recognition and Fall Detection System for Enhancement of Elderly Care

## Abstract
The elderly population has been rapidly rising in the recent years, placing extra demand on
healthcare facilities like hospitals and aged care facilities. This rising demographic has also
placed a lot of pressure on healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses and carers due to a
critical shortage of staff. Therefore, round the clock monitoring of vulnerable elderly patients
susceptible to falls and gait disorders, proves to be immensely difficult. Often random falls of
elderly patients go unnoticed for many minutes or even hours. When the patient is discovered,
irreversible damage to their body and health would have already occurred. This paper proposes
a novel IoT-enabled LiDAR framework designed for real-time detection of anomalies in the
Activities of Daily Living (ADLâ€™s) of Elderly Patients, falls and gait disorders. The framework
consists of four main components such as 3D LiDAR blender simulation, edge computing layer,
cloud computing layer and a patient activity monitoring web application. Algorithms for the
generation of simulated LiDAR data and data processing have been presented. The Raspberry
Pi 4 has been employed as the edge device along with Amazon Web Services for the cloud
computing layer. The IoT-LiDAR system has been tested for real-time performance. The results
data processing speed of the edge device is found to be 125ms and the end-to-end system
latency is 1.6 seconds. These results highlight the capability of the system to enable healthcare
professionals to rapidly respond to emergency situations and provide quality care to elderly
patients. This research thesis contributes to the field of healthcare by offering a non-obtrusive
privacy preserving solution to elderly patient activity monitoring in indoor environments.
